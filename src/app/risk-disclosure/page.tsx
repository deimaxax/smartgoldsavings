        <p className="mb-4">SmartGoldSavings.com refers interested parties to third-party precious metals dealers for educational purposes. We are not a financial advisory firm, and the content on this website does not constitute financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.</p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4">1. Capital at Risk</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Purchasing precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium) involves a significant degree of risk and is not suitable for all investors. The value of precious metals can go up as well as down. You could lose some or all of your initial investment. Past performance of precious metals is not a reliable indicator of future results.</p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4">2. Market Volatility</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Precious metals markets can be volatile and are affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to: global economic conditions, supply and demand, currency exchange rates, inflation, political events, and central bank policies. Prices can fluctuate rapidly.</p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4">3. Not a "Get Rich Quick" Scheme</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Precious metals should be considered a long-term hold, typically 5 to 10 years or more. They should not be used for short-term speculation. If you need immediate access to your capital, precious metals may not be the right asset class for you due to potential liquidation spreads.</p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4">4. Tax and Legal Implications</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">There may be tax consequences associated with purchasing, holding, and selling precious metals, including capital gains taxes. SmartGoldSavings.com does not provide tax advice. You are strictly advised to consult with your own certified public accountant (CPA) or tax professional regarding the tax implications of your specific situation before making any transaction.</p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4">5. No Guarantees</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">SmartGoldSavings.com and its partners make no guarantees regarding profit or the avoidance of loss. All investments are speculative.</p>
